<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bradycardia Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bradycardia devices market primarily includes pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Pacemakers regulate slow heart rates by delivering electrical impulses, ensuring consistent heart rhythm. They are commonly used for treating bradycardia. In contrast, ICDs monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks if a life-threatening arrhythmia is detected, providing both therapy for arrhythmias and prevention of sudden cardiac death. These devices are crucial for managing heart health in patients with abnormal heart rhythms and improving their quality of life.</p></p>
