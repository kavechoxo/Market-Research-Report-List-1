<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EUV Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resist</li><li>Negative Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EUV resist market is divided into two main types: positive resist and negative resist. Positive resists become soluble when exposed to extreme ultraviolet light, allowing for the development of intricate patterns required in semiconductor manufacturing. Conversely, negative resists harden upon exposure, making the unexposed areas soluble. Both types play critical roles in defining features on silicon wafers, with specific applications depending on desired resolution, sensitivity, and process requirements in advanced lithography techniques for cutting-edge electronics.</p></p>
